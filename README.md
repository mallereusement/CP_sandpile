## Computational Physics WS 23/24
### Project: Sandpile

#### Done
- Plot P(S, T, L)
- Plot conditional expectation values
- generalize to d dimensions

#### ToDo
- Power Spectrum
- calculate exponents from simulation data
- error calculation
- folder for plots and data
- 

#### Ideas

- initialize specific starting conditions
- ability to make a shape in three dimensions and translate it into z-grid
- what happens if sand is not just added random but follows a specific PDF?
- intialize shape and look how long it takes to get detroyed by added sand
- make animations of avalanches
- 


#### Questions
- Power spectrum
- heatmap: avalanches only at boundarys of grid?
