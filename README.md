## Computational Physics WS 23/24
### Project: Sandpile

#### Done
- Plot P(S, T, L)
- Plot conditional expectation values


#### ToDo
- Power Spectrum
- calculate exponents from simulation data
- error calculation

#### Ideas
- generalize to d dimensions
- initialize specific starting conditions
- ability to make a shape in three dimensions and translate it into z-grid
- what happens if sand is not just added random but follows a specific PDF?
- intialize shape and look how long it takes to get detroyed by added sand
- make animations of avalanches
-
